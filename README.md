Quest Hierarchy (Preview Expectations before developing the GUI)
=======================
Scene 1

When opening the application, I want it to show the title of the application saying "Quest.IO".

If never been used, it should ask if you would like to "Create a Task".

If used previously, show "Running" task with their title and date started on the List box.

If uses previously, show the search option to find a task you want to look/view/edit.

Functions:
-Task Creation Function = In-progress
-Listbox (Hold Previous Made Tasks)  = In-progress
-Search function  = In-progress
-Edit function (for click and edit or search and view/edit)  = In-progress
-Quit Function  = In-progress


=======================

Scene 2

Within "Create a Task", it will have Title of Task, Description that explains the task, Objectives/Side Missions to complete the task in-hand, and percentage meter for how close to completing Objectives/side missions (Checklist). Also, the possibility of deleting entire Objectives/Side Mission to add new set of Objectives/Side missions. Lastly, Finished editing task and official confirming the "Run" of a Task.

Functions:
-Title = Completed
-Description = Completed
-Checklist (Objectives/Side Missions) = In-progress
-Percentage Meter with Mark for Completion) = Not Implemented Yet
-Delete  = Not Implemented Yet
-Run Task = In-progress

=======================

This is similar to the first Scene, it will show running tasks and user is able to view/edit/delete a task.
